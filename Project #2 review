One thing I learned
I learned alot about blog writing style and that writiing a blog post is a lot different than writing a an essay. I had a little bit of a difficulty mving from the formal writing of an essay to the more informal blog style.


One thing that is still unclear
I am still a little unclear why we had to write a blog and I am not sure how this is going to translate into my future career. However, it was nice to be abke to pick my own topic and focus on a topic which I love.
