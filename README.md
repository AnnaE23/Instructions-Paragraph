# My work flow

During my College career I have typically used a very basic work flow system. This system included word documents and google drive. I have just recently started utilizing one drive as my major back up and portablity system.

I had previously only used word as my backup system ,but after an incident in which my computer crashed and I lost all the content in my document I began backing up my work in differnt locations. Even when using microsoft word documents I have rarely used track changes as I have never found that it helped me to more clearly communicate my thoughts and ideas.

# **Anatomy and Physiology of Cattle** 
## Vulva
  ### Three main functions
  * passage for urine
  * opening for mating
  * part of the birth canal

## Fornix
  * pocket around cervical opening

## Uterus
  Main function to proivide a suitable enviroment for fetal development. When the cow is bred the uterine muscles, under the influence of *oxytocin*, rythmically contract to aid in sperm transport to oviducts
  
## Oviduct/Fillopian Tubes
  The lower section of the oviduct which is closest to the uterus is called the *isthmus*. The connection between the uterus and the isthmus is called the **UTJ** or **U**teral **T**ubal **J**unction.



# Instructions-Paragraph

A good experience I had with an instruction manual was when putting together a shelf from ikea. The instructions were clearly laid out and had numbered steps that were large and easy to follow. The instructions also clearly labeled each indivudual piece and the direction each piece should be facing, as well as includeing clear figures of the entire process.
