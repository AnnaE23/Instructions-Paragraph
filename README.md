# Instructions-Paragraph

A good experience I had with an instruction manual was when putting together a shelf from ikea. The instructions were clearly laid out and had numbered steps that were large and easy to follow. The instructions also clearly labeled each indivudual piece and the direction each piece should be facing, as well as includeing clear figures of the entire process.
