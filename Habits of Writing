Usual process of writing, how I can improve, and one strength 

When writing I am typically a procrastinator. If the project requires research I usually find all the imformation that the assignment/topic requires and then organize my thoughts and ideas in a word document. At this point I don't start the actual writing process of the assignement until a few days before it is due. I can improve this process by doing my reasearch and then working on the project a little bit every day until the assignment is completed, instead of putting the assingment off until closer to the date that it is due.
I would say that one strength is that I do the intial thinking and outlining early on in the project.
